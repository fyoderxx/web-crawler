Web Crawler made in python<hr>

&#9679; A Web crawler, sometimes called a spider or spiderbot and often shortened to crawler, is an Internet bot that systematically browses the World Wide Web, typically for the purpose of Web indexing (web spidering). Web search engines and some other sites use Web crawling or spidering software to update their web content or indices of others sites' web content. Web crawlers copy pages for processing by a search engine which indexes the downloaded pages so users can search more efficiently.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Crawling.py has two functions, crawling through news and website... Bit by bit I'm adding more. The search engine I use for the news is Google, over time I will add more search engines.
